A handy little application to add two digital timers to your favorite Coffeemill. 
Hardware: Any I2C type Display that supports Adafruit GFX Library, I used a 0.96" OLED
Any Incrementaltype Two-Port Encoder with pushbutton or any additional button.
The Built-In triggerswitch of your mill or another random pushbutton.
Uses arduino´s internal pullup-resistors, so no need to add some but it does no harm to use any. 
Any sink-powered 5V relais capable of switching your mill motor´s operating voltage and current.
Any 5V power supply.
I used a ardunio Nano, should work on any other arduino, might need some ajustments on the pin-layout.
Used and tested on an Eureka MCI only! Should work for all milltypes using a 230V AC motor.
